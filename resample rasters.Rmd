This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(raster)
library(stringr)

files <- c(list.files('data/',pattern = '.tif',full.names = T),list.files('data/covariates/',pattern = '.tif',full.names = T))

for (f in files){
raster <- raster(f)

downscale <- 3

lo_res <- aggregate(raster, fact=downscale)

new_name <- str_replace(f, '.tif', paste0('_lo_res_',downscale,'.tif'))

writeRaster(lo_res,new_name)
}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
