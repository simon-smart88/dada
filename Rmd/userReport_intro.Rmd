```{r, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knit_engines$set(asis = function(options) {
  if (options$echo && options$eval) knit_child(text = options$code)
})
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE)
```

Please find below the R code history from your *DADA* session. 

You can reproduce your session results by running this R Markdown file in RStudio. 

Each code block is called a "chunk", and you can run them either one-by-one or all at once by choosing an option in the "Run" menu at the top-right corner of the "Source" pane in RStudio. 

For more detailed information see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>).
